--------------------------INVITE--------------------------
用途：
SIP的邀请功能主要用来向指定目标发出会话邀请(比如打电话)

The most important method in SIP is the INVITE method, which is used
to establish a session between participants.

The INVITE
method is the only way defined in this specification to establish a
dialog.

--------------------------Register--------------------------
用途：
SIP的注册功能主要用来构建"定位服务(location service)"所需的数据库
Registration is used for "routing"incoming SIP requests


Bob is not limited to registering from a single device. For example,
both his SIP phone at home and the one in the office could send
registrations. This information is stored together in the location
service and allows a proxy to perform various types of searches to
locate Bob. Similarly, more than one user can be registered on a
single device at the same time.

什么是定位服务？
The location service is just an abstract concept. It generally
contains information that allows a proxy to input a URI and receive a
set of zero or more URIs that tell the proxy where to send the
request. Registrations are one way to create this information, but
not the only way. Arbitrary mapping functions can be configured at
the discretion of the administrator.

Since registrations play an important role in
SIP, a UAS that handles a REGISTER is given the special name
registrar.


--------------------------Dialog--------------------------
A dialog is a
peer-to-peer SIP relationship between two user agents that persists
for some time.

The invite method is the ONLY WAY defined in this specification to 
establish a dialog.

Dialogs are discussed thoroughly in Section 12


--------------------------Session--------------------------
A session is a
collection of participants, AND streams of media between them, for
the purposes of communication.

How sessions are initiated, resulting in one or more SIP dialogs 
---> Section 13
How characteristics of that session are modified through
the use of an INVITE request within a dialog
---> Section 14
How a session is terminated
---> Section 15


--------------------------ARCH--------------------------
Proxy servers, location servers, and registrar servers defined above are logical
entities; implementations MAY combine them into a single application.


--------------------------SIP Messages--------------------------
SIP Messages: Requests Message  &  Responses Message


(start-line)Request-Line / Status-Line
*message-header
CRLF
[ message-body ]


--------------------------Request-Line--------------------------
"SIP requests" are distinguished by having a "Request-Line" for a start-line.

	Request-Line = Method SP Request-URI SP SIP-Version CRLF

Method(six methods):
REGISTER for "registering" contact information
INVITE, ACK, and CANCEL for "setting up" sessions
BYE for "terminating" sessions
OPTIONS for "querying" servers about their capabilities.

Request-URI:
SIP or SIPS URI,It indicates the user or service to which this request is "being" addressed.


--------------------------Status-Line--------------------------
"SIP responses" are distinguished from requests by having a "Status-Line"
as their start-line. 
	
	Status-Line = SIP-Version SP Status-Code SP Reason-Phrase CRLF
	
Status-Code:
	1xx: Provisional -- request received, continuing to process therequest;
	2xx: Success -- the action was successfully received, understood,and accepted;
	3xx: Redirection -- further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request;
	4xx: Client Error -- the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled at this server;
	5xx: Server Error -- the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request;
	6xx: Global Failure -- the request cannot be fulfilled at any server.


--------------------------*message-header(Header Fields)--------------------------
SIP header fields are similar to HTTP header fields in both syntax
and semantics.



--------------------------UA Behavior--------------------------
UAC and UAS procedures depend strongly on two factors. First, based
on whether the request or response is inside or outside of a dialog,
and second, based on the method of a request. 




--------------------------Structure of the Protocol--------------------------
SIP is structured as a layered protocol, which means that its
behavior is described in terms of a set of fairly independent
processing stages with only a loose coupling between each stage.

Transport(传输) layer(2nd) defines how a client
sends requests and receives responses and how a server receives
requests and sends responses over the network.

Transactions(事务) layer(3rd) are a fundamental component of SIP.
What transaction layer do？
	1.handlesapplication-layer retransmissions
	2.matching of responses to requests
	3.application-layer timeouts
Any task that a user agent client (UAC) accomplishes takes place using "a series of transactions".
--->Section 17 
Transaction = client's transaction + server's transaction + link between c&s

each of UAC & UAS are represented by a "finite state machine" that is constructed to
"process a particular request".

Transaction User layer(4th) is above the 3rd layer, called "TU".
Each of the SIP entities, "except" the stateless proxy, is a
transaction user(TU).(一个Entry 就是一个TU？)

The SIP elements, that is, user agent clients and servers, stateless
and stateful proxies and registrars, contain a core that
distinguishes them from each other. Cores, except for the stateless
proxy, are transaction users. 
UAC,UAS,无状态代理服务器，注册服务器,这些SIP元素，都有自己的"核心"职责,这些职责
的差异也就是这些元素之间的差异。这些"核心"也叫做TU(无状态代理服务器除外)。
小结：TU就是指在分层结构中，各个组件的"司职"

When a client cancels a transaction, it requests that the server stop
further processing, "revert" to the state that existed before the
transaction was initiated, and generate a specific error response to
that transaction.
